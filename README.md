# Data-from-Endurance-and-Impact-Activities

Data from "Endurance and impact activities differentially influence femoral cross-sectional geometry and mineral apposition"

## Reproduce analyses

1. Band Counts

  - `Sector scoring.R` carries out ordinal logistic regression on counts of fluorochrome bands.

2. Body Mass

  - `Mass and Femur Length Analysis.R` carries out analyses of body mass and femur length. Creates plot of masses over time.

3. Histomorphometry

  - `Histomorphometry.R` carries out analyses of traits measured from mid-femoral cross sections.

4. MAR

  - `Mineral_Apposition_Rate.R` carries out analyses of mineral apposition rates

5. `power_analysis.R` is the original power analyses carried out when designing the experiment
